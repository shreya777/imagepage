    <h2>EYE</h2>
    <p>The eye in the image displays a condition known as
heterochromia, which is the term used to describe a difference in coloration of the iris, the colored part of the eye.
This variation in color is due to the concentration and distribution of melanin, the pigment that gives eyes their color. In most cases, it is a harmless genetic trait, but it can sometimes be a sign of an underlying medical condition, especially if it develops later in life.</p>

    <h2>Specs</h2>
    <p>"Specs" generally refers to
    eyeglasses or spectacles, vision-correcting eyewear with lenses in a frame,
     but in a broader technical sense, "specifications" are detailed documents outlining requirements for products, 
    systems, or projects, covering features, performance, materials, and standards. So, the description depends on context: 
    it's either glasses for seeing or detailed technical blueprints</p>
